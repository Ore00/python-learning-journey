# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains Python code and projects that I have completed as part of the [FreeCodeCamp Python Course]([https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)). The code is developed and tested using the [Replit platform](https://replit.com/).

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to document my journey in learning Python, showcase the projects and exercises I have completed, and provide a reference for others who might be on a similar path.

## Contents

The repository includes:

- **Basic Python Syntax and Fundamentals:** Exercises and examples covering the basics of Python, including variables, data types, loops, and conditionals.
- **Data Structures:** Code examples that demonstrate the use of lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
- **Functions:** Python scripts that explore the creation and use of functions, including recursion and higher-order functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Projects and exercises that implement classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Modules and Packages:** Examples of how to use Python's built-in modules and how to create custom packages.
- **File Handling:** Scripts that demonstrate reading from and writing to files.
- **Error Handling:** Code that shows how to handle exceptions and errors in Python.
- **Projects:** Larger, more complex projects that apply the concepts learned in real-world scenarios.

## How to Use
